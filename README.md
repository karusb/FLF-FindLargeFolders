# FLF-FindLargeFolders
Are you tired of being unable to find what is using up precious hard disk space? Find that huge folder that you didn't know it was there.

Very easy to use, select drive and press start. Top directories are not scanned, press "S" to scan, press "+" to see other folders. 
Increase maximum number of folders when required. (Using more than 10 is recommended for large folders such as Program Files)
